We present an integrated approach—PlaceMyFossils—specifically designed to (1) thoroughly evaluate the phylogenetic placement of given fossil species on a backbone reference tree, (2) determine which characters and character partitions are most relevant in defining the fossil placement, (3) assess the confidence of the results, and (4) define the optimal analytical conditions to place the query species. PlaceMyFossils combines several analyses implemented as an interactive script for TNT (Tree Analysis Using New Technologies software),
